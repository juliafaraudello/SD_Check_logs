# SD_Check_logs


This script uses libraries like numpy, pandas, datetime and glob. 

It searches a directory for the last modified file, performs a series of checks to verify that the information is correct, and if it meets certain conditions, an automatic message is sent via webhook. If it does not comply with the pre-established conditions, the error is communicated by the .cmd.
